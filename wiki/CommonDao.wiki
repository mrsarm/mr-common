This modules support the *persistent layer*, built on top of the [http://www.hibernate.org/ Hibernate] framework and [http://www.springsource.org/ Spring] DAO support.

The plus of this modules is the *audit support*. All record of the database are audited.


== Details ==
The audit information is:
  * Logical delete.
  * The user who created the record and when he did.
  * The last user who edited the registry and when it did.
  * The last user who deleted the registry and when it did.


== Classes ==
This is an example of how to *model entities*: In the example we have a class Person, who was born in a country. All model classes are audited.
